# Loan Application Automation (API + UI)

This project automates a **loan application process** by combining **REST API testing** with **Playwright UI automation**, all in **Python**.  

The flow is fully scripted to simulate a real customer journey:
1. User login (API)
2. Loan application process via API steps:
   - Finance
   - Verification
   - Simmah Consent
   - Counter
   - e-Promissory Note
   - (Pause for manual confirmation)
   - Contract
   - OTP
   - IVR
3. Dashboard verification using Playwright (headless browser).
